A mitochondria-localized pentatricopeptide repeat protein was identified by positional cloning and transferred into the hau CMS line, where it successfully restored fertility Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is a maternally inherited trait that can be controlled by restorer-of-fertility (Rf) genes present in the nucleus. The hau CMS was identified as a new form of CMS associated with the mitochondrial transcript orf288; however, a lack of a restorer gene has limited its utilization in Brassica crops. Here, the combination of Brassica 60 K array with bulk segregant analysis and map-based cloning was used to delimit the Rfh locus to an 82.2-kb region on chromosome A09. A candidate gene encoding a mitochondria-localized pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein was identified and transferred into the hau CMS line, where it successfully restored the fertility of the hau CMS plants. Furthermore, the expression analysis showed that Rfh was highly expressed in the flower buds, and the sequence analysis results implied that functional divergence between RFH and rfh could be due to 59 amino acid residue differences in the deduced protein sequences. In addition, a co-separated molecular marker was developed based on the divergent sequences between the dominant and recessive alleles. These results will help enable the heterosis of Brassica crops in the future.
