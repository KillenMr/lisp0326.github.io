PPR proteins, comprising a large group of RNA binding proteins in terrestrial plants, function as sequence-specific single-stranded RNA binding proteins that modulate mitochondrial and chloroplast gene expression through post-transcriptional processes, such as RNA cleavage, splicing, stabilization, degradation, and editing. In a similar manner to most other RF-related PPR proteins, RFP belongs to the classical P subclass of proteins, which thus far have been shown to lack catalytic sites. Therefore, RFP may function with additional factors. As a next step, we will attempt to express RFP protein in vitro or in vivo and identify its cofactor(s). The current results provide a basis for investigating how RFP acts with other cofactor(s) to recognize CMS-related mRNAs and target them for the next processing step. In addition, our findings lay the foundation for further elucidating the molecular mechanism of CMS fertility restoration and the nuclearâ€“mitochondrial interactions in CMS/Rf systems.
