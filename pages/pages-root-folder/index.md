## Research Overview
We are interested in the molecular mechanism that control the activities of genes across development in B.napus male sterility, using a combination of  classical genetics, bioinformatics and molecular experiment. In addition, we are currently working on the mapping of genes related to rape root development and the exploration of rape SNP molecular markers and their applications in rape molecular breeding.

We warmly welcome talents with multi-disciplinary backgrounds to join our team to jointly engage in rape-related research.
