[The Bin Yi lab](http://cpst.hzau.edu.cn/info/1024/1798.htm) is a professor at Huazhong Agricultural University. At present, our lab is mainly engaged in the molecular mechanism of rape male sterility, gene mapping related to root development of rape, and the discovery of rape SNP molecular markers and their application in molecular breeding of rape.

  title="Transcriptome and organellar sequencing highlights the complex origin and diversification of allotetraploid Brassica napus"

  description="Brassica napus, an allotetraploid crop, is hypothesized to be a hybrid from unknown varieties of Brassica rapa and Brassica oleracea. Despite the economic importance of B. napus, much is unresolved regarding its phylogenomic relationships, genetic structure, and diversification. Here we conduct a comprehensive study among diverse accessions from 183 B. napus (including rapeseed, rutabaga, and Siberian kale), 112 B. rapa, and 62 B. oleracea and its wild relatives. Using RNA-seq of B. napus accessions, we define the genetic diversity and sub-genome variance of six genetic clusters. Nuclear and organellar phylogenies for _B. napus_ and its progenitors reveal varying patterns of inheritance and post-formation introgression. We discern regions with signatures of selective sweeps and detect 8,187 differentially expressed genes with implications for B. napus diversification. This study highlights the complex origin and evolution of B. napus providing insights that can further facilitate B. napus breeding and germplasm preservation."
