[The Bin Yi lab](http://cpst.hzau.edu.cn/info/1024/1798.htm) is a professor at Huazhong Agricultural University. At present, our lab is mainly engaged in the molecular mechanism of rape male sterility, gene mapping related to root development of rape, and the discovery of rape SNP molecular markers and their application in molecular breeding of rape.

  title="Transcriptome and organellar sequencing highlights the complex origin and diversification of allotetraploid _Brassica napus_"

  description="_Brassica napus_, an allotetraploid crop, is hypothesized to be a hybrid from unknown varieties of _Brassica rapa_ and _Brassica oleracea_. Despite the economic importance of _B. napus_, much is unresolved regarding its phylogenomic relationships, genetic structure, and diversification. Here we conduct a comprehensive study among diverse accessions from 183 _B. napus_ (including rapeseed, rutabaga, and Siberian kale), 112 _B. rapa_, and 62 _B. oleracea_ and its wild relatives. Using RNA-seq of _B. napus_ accessions, we define the genetic diversity and sub-genome variance of six genetic clusters. Nuclear and organellar phylogenies for _B. napus_ and its progenitors reveal varying patterns of inheritance and post-formation introgression. We discern regions with signatures of selective sweeps and detect 8,187 differentially expressed genes with implications for _B. napus_ diversification. This study highlights the complex origin and evolution of _B. napus_ providing insights that can further facilitate _B. napus_ breeding and germplasm preservation."
