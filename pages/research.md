[The Bi Yi lab](http://cpst.hzau.edu.cn/info/1024/1798.htm) is a professor at Huazhong Agricultural University. At present, our lab is mainly engaged in the molecular mechanism of rape male sterility, gene mapping related to root development of rape, and the discovery of rape SNP molecular markers and their application in molecular breeding of rape.

  title="Genomic analysis of the Stat1-/- mouse model of ER+ breast cancer"

  description="ER+ luminal tumors are the most frequent subtype of breast cancer. Stat1−/− mice develop mammary tumors that closely resemble this cancer subtype. To identify transforming events that contribute to tumorigenesis, we performed whole genome sequencing of Stat1−/− primary mammary tumors and matched normal tissues. This investigation identified somatic truncating mutations affecting the prolactin receptor (Prlr) in all tumor samples. Targeted sequencing confirmed the presence of these mutations in precancerous lesions, indicating this is an early event in tumorigenesis. Functional evaluation showed that co-expression of truncated and wild type Prlr led to aberrant Stat3 and Stat5 activation downstream of the receptor, cellular transformation in vitro and tumor formation in vivo."
